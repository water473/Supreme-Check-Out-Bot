# Auto Check-Out bot for online shopping
- Here I made a concept for an auto check out bot, in this case for the store https://supreme.com/

## Key Attributes
- The main library I used was Selenium to deal with a chrome browser.
- By supplying the bot with a product link:

The bot will add to cart and go on to checkout with your pre-entered shipping/billing information.

- I used the XPath of the elements on the website, such as the add to cart button, for selenium to properly complete the process.
-   I didn't use element ID becuase it wasn't available for every button I needed on the website.

## Headless Version
- I also made a headless version, which completes the same process but in the background, without opening up a pop-up chrome browser.

## Old Version
- Not that this was made for the https://supreme.com/ of 2021-2022, and the site has since been reformed.
